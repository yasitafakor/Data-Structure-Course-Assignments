# Shortest Path Finder

This Java program calculates the shortest path between two vertices in an unweighted graph using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. It is designed to handle multiple test cases where each graph may have different vertices and edges.

## Features

- **Graph Representation:** The graph is represented using an adjacency list.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Utilized to find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges between the start and destination vertices.
- **Handles Multiple Test Cases:** The program can process multiple graphs in a single run.
