# Data Structure Projects

This repository contains a collection of my projects from the Data Structures course. Each project demonstrates the application of different algorithms and data structures to solve specific problems. Below is a brief overview of each project:

## 1. **Arithmetic Expression Evaluator**
- **Description:** This project evaluates arithmetic expressions involving integers, basic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`), and parentheses, computing the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.
- **Key Concepts:** Stack-based expression evaluation, operator precedence, and modulo arithmetic.

## 2. **Graph Traversal and Minimum Accumulation Path Calculation**
- **Description:** A graph traversal algorithm using BFS and a greedy approach to calculate the minimum cost required to traverse a graph, considering the values associated with each vertex.
- **Key Concepts:** Breadth-First Search (BFS), greedy algorithms, graph traversal.

## 3. **Shortest Path Finder Using BFS**
- **Description:** This project finds the shortest path between two vertices in an unweighted graph using the BFS algorithm, handling multiple test cases.
- **Key Concepts:** BFS for shortest path calculation, adjacency list representation of graphs.
